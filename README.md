# Markov-Chain-Disease-Simulation

Very simple markov chain simulation. The setting is a disease outbreak where each person has a probability for becoming ill, recovering while being ill, dying and becoming ill after being recovered.

It is interesting to see how the outbreak explodes in the begining of the simulation and the disease slowly dissapear after a while. As seen ![here](https://github.com/erlendlokna/Markov-Chain-Disease-Simulation/blob/main/figs/EvOf300withCas.pdf)

One of the projects given in a course called Stochastic modelling at NTNU.
